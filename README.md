## Project description

This project seeks to identify credit card customers that are most likely to churn.

Customer churn is the occurrence of customers discontinuing their usage of a product or service or leaving a business.
Predicting it allows for targeted interventions (such as special discounts or follow-ups) to customers which are likely
to churn in the near future. The cost of lost revenue is usually much greater than any discounts that could be offered.
The task was to predict which customers are likely to churn in the near future.

:star2: Highlights:

1. The project follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented and
   tested).
2. The model has outstanding accuracy and good sensitivity.
3. Methods of Explainable AI (XAI) ensure the model is not just a black box but makes transparent and reliable
   decisions. This facilitates trust in the predictions and makes them more accountable.

On the backend predictions are made using <u>two models</u>:

1. `Random Forest` classifier


2. `Logistic Regression` classifier

## Models

### Metrics

Overall the `Random Forest` model seems to have better performance as is visible in the ROC plot:

![ROC](images/results/roc_curve.png "ROC")

The `Random Forest` forest has a weighted average F1-score of 0.93.

The `Logistic regression` forest has a slightly lower weighted average F1-score of 0.89.

<img src="images/results/metrics_lr.png" width="350">


Both models display a better performance on the majority class, which is to be expected.

### Features

To ensure the model makes transparent predictions methods of explainable AI (XAI) were used.

One such method is the feature importance through ```Shapley``` values:

<p align="center"><img src="images/results/feature_importance.png" width="500"></p>

According to this analysis the most impactful feature is the total transaction count in the last 12
months```Total_Trans_Ct```. This feature follows a bimodal distribution.

![features](images/eda/total_trans_histplot.png "features")

The second most important is the total transaction amount. On the third place is the revolving balance.

## Getting started

### Requirements

Make sure all module requirements are met or install them with:

~~~bash
python -m pip install -r requirements_py3.6.txt
~~~

or alternatively for ```python==3.8```

~~~bash
python -m pip install -r requirements_py3.8.txt
~~~

### Usage

The main code can be found in ```churn_library.py```.

Upon **execution**:

1. The dataset ```/data/bank_data.csv``` is imported
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will be performed
3. all categorical variables will be encoded with the proportion of churn
4. the dataset is split (feature engineering)
5. the models are trained
6. all results, graphics and models are saved and stored

### Running

The program can be run interactively:

~~~bash
ipython churn_library.py 
~~~

or also purely from the command line (CLI):

~~~bash
python churn_library.py 
~~~

## Unit testing

This project is built with unit tests which also log any errors, info and warning messages to a log file.

To test all functions and log the respective results, please run:

~~~bash
ipython churn_script_logging_and_tests.py 
~~~

To test a single function ```function_of_interest``` run:

~~~bash
pytest -v churn_script_logging_and_tests.py::function_of_interest
~~~

The argument ```-v``` is optional to see which function was tested

## Acknowledgments

* The dataset is open source and stems from LEAPS Analyttica. It consists of 10,000 customers mentioning their age,
  salary, marital_status, credit card limit, credit card category, etc.
* The project is part of the ML DevOps Engineer Udacity Nanodegree.
